      Howdy! I'm Sean, the designer of the items you can find on this website!<br>
      <br>
      I've been playing, homebrewing and building TTRPGs for the last decade and a half, and enjoy creating items, monsters and rules as I need them.<br>
      <br>
      This website was built as a way to share these creations with more people. Feedback, suggestions and requests are welcome!<br>

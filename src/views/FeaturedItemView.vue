            <br>A scarred, metal-reinforced leather guantlet inscribed with glowing runes on the metal plates, along with a fist as the maker's mark.
                It was discovered in a buried research facility by explorers. Who knows what powers the guantlet is imbued with?

            the target suffers an additional 1d4 force damage..
            On a 1 (before modifiers or bonuses), the user suffers 1d2 force damage as the magic backlashes.
